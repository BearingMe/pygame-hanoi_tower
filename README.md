This project is a simple implementation of the classic puzzle game "Towers of Hanoi" using Python and Pygame. In this version, players can choose to play in regular mode and solve the puzzle by moving the disks manually, or in automatic mode and watch the game solve the puzzle for them. To play, run the "hanoi.py" file and choose your desired mode.

This repository is not currently being actively updated, but it is (almost) a fully functional version of the classic puzzle game. The original creator of most part of the code is not clear, but they should be credited for their work.

All that said, overall, "pygame-hanoi_tower" is a great resource for those looking to learn and play the "Towers of Hanoi" puzzle game. Whether you want to test your problem-solving skills or simply relax and watch the game solve itself, this project has something to offer.
